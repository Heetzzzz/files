		let b = x + y; 		//either number+string or string+number.
		let c = w + x + y; 
		let d = x * z;

		document.write(a+"<br>");

		document.write(b+"<br>");

		document.write("Result is:-" + w + y + "<br>"); //it will be concat because print starting with string so that it will take varible as a string.

		document.write(c + "<br>"); //it will be concat because one of those values has string so that it will be concat all the variables.

		document.write(d + "<br>"); //if both string value has numbers that it will conver string to numaric nd print the output exept addition(+).

		//NaN and isNaN()

		//NaN mean for Not a number,it is the reserved word of java script.
		//if any arithmatic operation performe without numeric value than the output will be NaN.

		//isNaN is check the value is not a number. it with return true or false.

		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = isNaN(v);

		document.write(typeof(NaN));

		//Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.
