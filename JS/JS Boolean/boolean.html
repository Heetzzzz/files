		//only give true or false.
		//You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:

		// <,>,== and etc all basics java scripts cpmarisions conditions ans allowed in boolean.

		document.write(Boolean(10>9));  //u can also see the result eithout writting boolean keyword
		document.write(10>9);

		//Everything With a "Value" is True

		//if the value is 0(ZERO) than it will give u a flase.

		var x=0;
			x="";
			x=-0;
			x=;
			x=null;
			x=false;
			x=10/"hello";

			//ALL the above condisions are false beacause boolean has no value 

		//if u created boolean ovject than it will became the object datatype 
		//it willslow doen the execution speed.

		let x = false;  //boolean
		let y = new Boolean(false);  //object because of new keyword.

		//x==y is true because both are value have false
		//x===y is false because both the value are same but the datatypes are diffrent
